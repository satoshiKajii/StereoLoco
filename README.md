# StereoLoco

# Concept

The app is to make a monaural audio signal "pseudo-stereophonic". 

# Usage:

There are 2 sliders, one of which ("buffer size") determines incoming audio sample size 2^N (default N = 11), 
the other ("stereonize") adjusts stereo image (from -500 to 500. Double-click will return 0).

# system requirements 

stereo output: if your iPhone is older and has only a monaural speaker, just plug a stereo headphone.

AUv3 host: the app also works as AUv3 plugin.
